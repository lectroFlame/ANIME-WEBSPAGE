<strong>My Happy Marriage</strong> has come for another season. In an alternative version of the Taishō era in which spirits and magic are real, but in decline, Miyo Saimori, born without supernatural talent, is forced into an existence of servitude by her abusive stepmother. When Miyo finally comes of marriageable age, though, her hopes of being whisked away to a better life crumble after she discovers her fiancé's identity: Kiyoka Kudou, a commander apparently so cold and cruel that his previous would-be brides all fled within three days of their engagements. With no home to return to, Miyo resigns herself to her fate—and soon finds that her pale and handsome husband-to-be is anything but the monster she expected.

<p>
To be honest I am really hyped up for the continue of this anime, it is amazing, has one of the best soundtracks and intros.<strong>
It follows a youth with pyrokinetic abilities who joins a special force developed to counter pyrokinetic monsters threatening Tokyo, which is the sole remaining city in a world ravaged by a global fire.</strong> The anime show's second season wrapped in December 2020 and since Atsushi Ohkubo's original manga ended in 2022, fans are even more excited to see the final adventures of Company 8 brought to life – particularly now we have a release date.<strong>
April 2025 and the latter portion coming in January 2026.</strong>
There's no way they can ruin this and even if they do I'm still gonna watch and enjoy it

KAIJU NO. 8 <font color="white">SEASON 2
</font>
</table>

<p>
<strong>Kaiju No. 8</strong> will return for season two in 2025. The release window was confirmed at the end of a teaser trailer that dropped for Kaiju Day 2024, in early August.

Sadly, at this point, we don't have a firmer date or time of year, so you'll just have to check back for news and updates.
Since Kaiju No. 8 exploded onto our screens showering our eyes with monster blood and guts galore, we've been hooked.

But it's not the glorious visuals alone that sustained us throughout season one. It was the oh-so-lovable, goofy (if not slightly desperate)<strong> Kafka Hibino and his relentless attempt to join the Defence Force that kept us going.</strong>

Nothing could stop him from achieving his dreams of becoming a Kaiju hunter, not even becoming a Kaiju himself.

Season one saw Kafka fumble his way to a place on the battlefield while trying to keep his secret. But now that his monster identity is out there for the world to see, it can only mean one thing: an exciting, action-packed season two.

The popular superhero anime is coming to an end, as the final season drops in 2025.

My Hero Academia has announced that Season 8 of the anime will be serving as the final season, and now it’s been confirmed that the final season will be hitting in the <strong>Fall of 2025</strong>. My Hero Academia brought Season 7 to an end earlier this Fall as fans saw Izuku Midoriya and the other heroes continue to struggle in the final battles against the villains. But with many of these fights reaching their respective ends, now only All For One and Tomura Shigaraki remain standing as the final opponents to take down before this long and grueling war can come to an end.
